[Diffler](http://diffler.clovery.si/) is a front-end design made for a NFT Marketplace. It features everything a modern website might need, including a Home, Explore, Activity and a Contact page.
###### It also features a Sign Up and a Login page to simulate the use of [WebStorage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp). 
###### It also has a page made for [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/), which is normally used for connection to the blockchain. I've also provided logos for each wallet connection.


## Demo

This is a [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) page. It features all major Crypto Wallet connections. Script integration could be done very easily.
